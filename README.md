This is my Twitter clone application. I have utilized the useState hook to manage state variables and ensure the page continuously renders while updating these state variables. This application closely emulates the functionality of Twitter, featuring three main sections: the sidebar, home, and widgets.

The sidebar is static, providing constant navigation elements. The home section is dynamic, allowing users to compose tweets. I've integrated Redux to handle complex states and share data among different components efficiently.

Users can compose tweets with both text and images. In the widgets section, users can access a Quazi Twitter profile and view their tweets. Additionally, users have the option to tweet directly to Quazi. The widget section is powered by the react-twitter-embed library, seamlessly integrating React with Twitter functionalities.

To enhance the visual appeal of this application, I've incorporated the react-icons library, especially for the use of icons.
